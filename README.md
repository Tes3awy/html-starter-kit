# Documentation

You need to run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then just run `npm run watch` and you're ready to start your project right away.

Once the dependecies are installed, and `npm run watch` is running in your terminal. Open `index.html` and save it, a `dist` folder will immediatly be created.

Carefully inspect `gulpfile`. It's well commented and you'll easily understand it.
